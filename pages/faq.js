                    It all depends on project nature and scope of work. However,
                    usually, the pre-project evaluation and documentation take
                    3-4 days. Our design and planning phase takes 1 week. We
                    initiate development after that.

                  <p>
                    For each project, typical team size is 2-3 developers
                    depending on the project scope, workload and timeline for
                    deliverables. Each development team is supported by UI/UX
                    designers, QA engineers, project coordinators, and more
                    developers if required. These sharing support resources for
                    each project helps us accelerate the completion process with
                    reduced costs for the clients.
